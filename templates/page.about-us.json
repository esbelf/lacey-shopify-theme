Growing up, during the spring and summer, we spent all our time on the water - swimming, fishing, sailing, and boating. In the winter when the lakes were frozen over, we’d play ice hockey until the wee hours of the night.<\/p><p>Needless to say, lakes and the health of lakes have always been a part of our lives.<\/p>",
